# Why?
Last year I started dabbling with the nitty gritty of game engine development. I read a lot about game design in my life and I had all these ideas floating around in my head like "why can't I use a mechanic I've coded before in this new project" and "why am I wasting so much time to code this, someone must have figured it out before". To answer those questions I created a new engine paradigm that became my capstone project at university. To demonstrate the concepts I was messing with I also created [Writ](www.writplatform.com), a little text adventure game engine that is completely modular and provides standardized abstractions so you can just load pre-coded game mechanics. Writ is still under development, however it is also very simple, made mostly to deal with text-based content, and whether or not it will be accepted by the community at large remains to be seen.

In the meantime, I grew in love with engine development. I wanted to explore what was possible and learn more about it. In particular, I spent so much time with design that I wanted to see if the ideas of user-driven design could be mixed with the more hardcore techniques of low level development while retaining a reasonable performance. It also became clear to me when I joined college that it wouldn't give me a straight path to what I wanted to become. To get there I would have to find my own way and put effort into it. That vision is what motivated me to start this project.


# What?
I've decided to try my best to create a fully featured game engine in the year of 2018.
My goal is to create an engine that focus on the non-programmer developer, that still remains reasonably efficient at runtime. This engine, cleverly named PlugNPlay by a friend of mine, will be built using the same modularity paradigm I used previously on Writ. It won't be a copy and paste of Writ either(Don't worry Pedro); we will be attempting to make a full fledged 3D engine, with rendering, animation, AI... and all those things no one ever pays attention too as well, like factories, allocators, dependency managers, etc.

Here is a list of my goals with this project:
* Create an engine that focus on the end user, being the least disruptive to workflow as possible.
* Achieve competitive graphical capabilities and performance equivalent to of an in-house indie engine.
* Enable GameRules modules through a well defined, expressive and standardized abstraction model.
* Learn as much as I can!


# How?!
Now, this will absolutely not be easy. Engines are complex beasts, and it takes a lot of time and effort to build one, not to mention skill way above mine currently. But I'm prepared to learn. I will be dedicating at least 8 hours every week to this project(with hopes of doing more as much as I can). To facilitate things, we will also make use of a few low level libraries, so we won't be coding everything from scratch.

To accompany this project, I've started a blog/journal, where I will be posting my experience weekly. As it is, I don't think it will be of much use to anyone other than myself, but once the project is over I plan on crafting a lengthy tutorial in which I share what I've learn in a more digestible format.

Finally, this project would not be possible if it weren't for the work of some awesome people. They are my guides and the inspiration that let me believe this mad journey is actually possible. If this project peaked your interest, have a look at their stuff(they are waaay better at this than I am).
